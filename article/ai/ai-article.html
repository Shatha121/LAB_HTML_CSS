                    <h2>What even <em>Is</em> AI?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (Al) refers to technology that allows computers and machines to imitate human abilities
    - like learning, understanding, solving problems, making decisions, being creative, and even acting on their
    own. Basically, it's about teaching machines how to think and behave in ways that feel human.</p>

                    <h2>How I'd Use AI as a Developer</h2>
                    <p>I'd still write my code manually. I want to understand what I'm doing.
    But I'd use Al to help me learn - like asking for explanations, checking my logic, or exploring different ways
    to solve a problem. It's like having a super fast teammate who can teach you things without giving you the
    full answer.</p>

                    <li>Write code manually before asking AI .</li>
                    <li>Ask AI only when stuck, not lazy .</li>
                    <li>Always test and understand AI suggestions .</li>
                    <li>Use AI as a tutor, not a crutch .</li>
